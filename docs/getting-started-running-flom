How to start the Docker 

createdb flom

To run on another port:

docker run -p 8000:3001  magnew/flom
* map port 3001 internally to port 8000 externally

Currently container has its own postgres DB that is transient


settings for FLOM - 

Marshall is available to help get the system up and running

Need some kind of user auth
	- Maybe a computable token that can be verified
	- CSV auth file of tokens
	- Pass in a URL
	- Hiroku could be used for auth
	- generate one-time auth tokens - do something simple
	- 


Stuff todo still:

- Set up postgres db in FLOM server outside of docker (running on docker host is ok)
- wire up docker containers to use the top level postgres install
- naming convention for container to database connector
-
