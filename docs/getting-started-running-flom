How to start the Docker 

createdb flom

To run on another port:

docker run -p 8000:3001  magnew/flom
* map port 3001 internally to port 8000 externally

Currently container has its own postgres DB that is transient


settings for FLOM - 

Marshall is available to help get the system up and running

Need some kind of user auth
	- Maybe a computable token that can be verified
	- CSV auth file of tokens
	- Pass in a URL
	- Hiroku could be used for auth
	- generate one-time auth tokens - do something simple
	- 

	- obfuscate URL for the FLOM API interface   or allow only from certain IP address range
	
    - may only need one single top level Postgres database	

    - feature add: survey id in the survey api - so can search by that
	
	- when you do a "docker build" (at build time is when you change database credentials
		 -credentials get built in to a binary that isnt easily 
		 starting from scratch will need a docker build with postgres crentials specified on the command line
		 
		 
		 Yarn is used as a task running - reads package.json - eventaully calls docker_start.sh -= may be where creds should live (?)
		 
		 need an optioon to start with embedded postgres vs "prodcution" outside of container postrgres
		 
		 - prod:start doent test for crash and restart itself
		 
		 Docker orchestration can get complicated in production, but this should be simpler than most cases
		 
		 

Stuff todo still:

- Set up postgres db in FLOM server outside of docker (running on docker host is ok)
- wire up docker containers to use the top level postgres install
- naming convention for container to database connector
- 
If doing a 50-state separate survey, could set things up to run a single docker instance and encode the survey id, state, etc in each URL request from 
users   (may need code changes)




pass in session auth token, Country, State, all on the URL line - from something encoded for sending to users in participation email

URL can be hacked to jump into another person's session as long as it isnt marked "complete"  
may want to obfuscate session id in URL string

Can query an API via flom...:8000/api/session/ to see all session
